# Student Performance Tracker

This project is a Python-based system to manage and track student grades using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It calculates averages, checks if students are passing, and provides performance feedback for both individual students and the entire class.

## How to Use:

- Clone the repository to your local machine or open the `.ipynb` file on Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
- Add student names and their scores for different subjects (Math, Science, English).
- The program will calculate the class average and individual student performance, displaying whether each student is passing or needs improvement.

## Features:

- Add students and input their grades.
- Calculate the average score for each student.
- Determine if a student is passing based on a minimum passing score (default: 40).
- Calculate and display the overall class average.

## Files:
- `student_performance_tracker.ipynb`: Jupyter/Colab notebook for the project.
- `student_performance_tracker.py`: Python script for the project.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x

If using Jupyter or Colab, simply run the cells in sequence to execute the code.

## Installation:

1. Clone the repository using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saadahmadrana/Student_Performance_Tracker.git

## CSV Export Feature
You can now export student performance to a CSV file.

Steps:
1. Run the app: `python OOP_Project.py`
2. Add students and scores.
3. Choose menu option 3 to export results.
4. Open `student_report.csv` in Excel or Google Sheets.

Output columns:
Student Name, Math, Science, English, Average, Status
